# BatSync

Syndicating bat call data and metadata to different biodiversity monitoring services

## Introduction

Welcome to BatSync!

This project started life as [Bat2iNat](https://github.com/AugustT/bat2inat).

See this 2022 presentation by Tom August on [Creating open, verifiable, acoustic
observations of bats](https://nbn.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2022_09-iNat-User-Group-Tom-August-Bat2iNat.pdf)

## What BatSync will do

* Take collections of bat call recordings, create spectrograms and tentative classifications, and send them on to "citizen science" cloud services
* Forward data either to iNaturalist or iRecord
* Support and help to develop community standards for bat call metadata
* Provide a web API, a python library and a commandline interface

## Our plans

We have support up to March 2026 to deliver: 

* A robust and reusable, self-hostable rewrite of the prototype application
* A clear workflow schema that ensures data is shared to relevant platforms to support research, policy, engagement, and AI development
* An engaged group of stakeholders/users who act as champions for the app going forward

## Data syndication

To "citizen science" collections that feed through to "research grade" archives:

* BatSync -> [iNaturalist](https://nbnatlas.org/) -> [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/)
* BatSync -> [iRecord](https://irecord.org.uk/) -> [NBN Atlas](https://nbnatlas.org/)
* BatSync -> Other?

## Community standards

[GUANO, the bat acoustic metadata specification](https://github.com/riggsd/guano-spec)
